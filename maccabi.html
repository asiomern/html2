<div>
Founded in 1906 in Jaffa as the HaRishon Le Zion-Yafo Association,<br>
it is the oldest and most decorated football club in Israel.<br>
With the establishment of the city of Tel Aviv in 1909, the club changed its name to Maccabi Tel Aviv.<br>
In 1922, it became the first Jewish football club to participate in local competitions.<br>
The meaning of the name Maccabi – 'there is no one like you among the gods' – forms an integral part of the character of the team, which took the Star of David as their logo to represent the Jewish people.<br>
Maccabi Tel Aviv have won more titles than any other Israeli club, winning League Championships, State Cups, seven Toto (League) Cups,[2] and two Asian Champion Club Tournaments before Israel were expelled from the AFC in 1974.
